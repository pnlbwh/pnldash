* BUG: make push expand ./caselist.txt
* STY: improve init's temmplate
* ENH: add 'env' command
* ENH: make `update` work with distributed projects
* ENH: add 'withpaths' option, similar to what i have in bash right now
  it would have to be: eval `pnldash env`
* validate pnldash.yml (in csvs.py for example)
